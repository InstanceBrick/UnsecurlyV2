**Before you deploy to Heroku, read the following: apparently, heroku decided that this repository violates the ToS, so directly clicking the button below if you're in the main repository will result in an error. You can avoid this by forking a repo, then clicking on this deploy button on your own cloned repo. However, I am NOT responsible if your heroku account gets suspended because of deploying this application. Proceed at your own risk.**
